h1. Day 2 Notes

h2. Using Views Programmatically

* Views is the most installed module
* Create lists of information in a friendly UI
* Views created in the UI are stored in the database
** File system backups are easier
** Version control of views via files is easier than databases
** Views in the database do not have revision control
** How do you know who/how the view was changed
** What caused the view to break
* Views in code save database queries
* Solutions
** Chaos Tools Bulk Exporter
* Admin -> Structure -> Views -> Add New
** Give it a name
** Save and Exit
* Admin -> Structure -> Views -> Tools -> Bulk Exporter
** Check the view to export and give it a name
** A @info@ and a @module@ file are displayed
** Install the module in @sites/all/modules@ according to the instructions
** Turn on the module
** Need to @revert@ the view which will delete it from the database and let the view in code not be overwritten
* Edit View -> Advanced -> Theme Information
** Copy the template in the theme, enable it, clear the cache
* Life of a View
** @views_get_view@ goes to database or code to pull up view
** @hook_views_pre_view@ great place to modify arguments

h2. Workbench

* Content in Drupal by default is published (live) or not published
* Workbench allows a non-published draft
* Drupal by default only allows permissions by content type
* Workbench allows the site maintainer to assign access to pieces of content
* Workbench shows you the content that you can create and edit, not all of the sites content
* You can define a state machine of content stages and transitions
** You can check that roles/permissions have been set correct
* You get a needs reviewed tab for checking content before publishing
